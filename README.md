# Steam_Games_Data_Viz
This repo contains the report for the project done during the Data Visualization course during our 7th semester. 
The project included analysing and creating dynamic dashboards depicting a data story with a proper feedback loop for data extracted from Steam linked [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1l8IBBeEQ0J52CNgGQrSi-toN6LCDY7pa?usp=sharing). All of the dashboards along with an explanation of the flow are written in the report in detail. Links to the dashboards are present at the end of the report.
